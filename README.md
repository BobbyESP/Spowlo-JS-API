<h3 align="center">The API that will temporarily be used to download songs from Spotify in Spowlo.</h3>

# How to use
First of all, this API was made with Node.js 15.x (works with 16.x) using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/).

The URL format that this API follows is : `https://yourURL.com/api/v1/spottoyt?song=(spotify link)`.

# To do
- [ ] Add MongoDB support or Map creation for saving Spotify to YouTube conversions (make less network calls)
- [ ] Make exception handling to make the API don't crash when a link is not valid.
